## 1. About Me: Thom2sa
Hello Sir & Team!
My name is Thom, I am from VietNam, I am 26 years old & I am a trusted node operator, we are currently managing and operating validator nodes of some projects, you can see below. We have used the best servers in the world, some large units we are cooperating with and using their servers such as: Hetzner, Vultr, Digitalocean in Germany and Finland to ensure the nodes we operate have the highest reliability, we are also using some tools we wrote and developed to monitor validator nodes.
We are always online 24/7 to maintain and handle errors that may occur during the node running process to ensure the project that we operate nodes has the best uptime >99%.
Right now we are using a backup power system and backing up data up to 50TB of data to ensure that all data of the validator nodes we operate is maximally secure!

We currently have 2 main members and 1 part-time apprentice, we are still recruiting more members who are passionate about node operation, code repair and spend 100% of their time to develop the team. We hope that with the knowledge we have acquired throughout the entire process of operating the node we have gone through, we can contribute to the StoryProtocol project to have the most successful testing round and help the project build more !! Thank you for listening.

Our mission is to empower you with the knowledge and skills to effectively run blockchain nodes, contributing to the robustness and resilience of decentralized networks.
